The purpose of this project was to build an event platform website. Organizations can create new events and manage participants 
in each event, while members can join events and view their upcoming events.

To run the project, first run: mvn clean install. 
Then you can either compile the project directly or run the jar file, using the command java -jar eventApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
